What's up fam? (I know, a little unprofessional, but this is even my greeting to my mom every time I see her. Hi mom!) 

My name is Josh and I built this site to talk about a combination of two of my passions. Sports and Numbers. Ever since I was little, I wanted to play every sport I could. Basketball, football, golf, just to name a few. You name it, I've probably tried it. While my athletic ability only took me to win one intramural championship in college, I've always wanted to be around some sort of game. Throughout my life, math has always been my strong suit and fortunately for me, statistics are collected from sports. Using statistics to predict outcomes, find trends, and be able to communicate with other people about different sports fascinates me. Through all of this, my passions have led me to develop an understanding of Sports Analytics and I hope to provide some thoughts, ideas, and solutions for the games we love. I hope to show you how I analytically think! 

Feel free to reach out and let me know if you have any questions or if you want to share any thoughts about my work or have any thoughts of your own. Always down to collaborate or talk about exciting ideas within sports. I'm on twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ATJoshBrown">@ATJoshBrown</a> or shoot me an email through the contact tab. Happy Thinking!
